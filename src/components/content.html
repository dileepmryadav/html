                    <h3>What is Small Business Relief?</h3>
                    <p>Small Business Relief is provided to small Businesses resident for Corporate Tax purposes in the
                        UAE to ease their implementation of the Corporate Tax regime. Small Business Relief reduces the
                        compliance obligations faced by small Businesses in the early stages of the Corporate Tax
                        regime, primarily by alleviating the burden of having to calculate and pay Corporate Tax.</p>
                    <p>Any eligible Taxable Person (being a Resident Taxable Person - either a Natural Person or a
                        Juridical Person) with Revenue below or equal to AED 3,000,000 <sup><a href='#bookmark1'
                                id='bookmarkback1'>[1]</a></sup> in a relevant Tax Period and all previous Tax Periods
                        that end on or before 31 December 2026 <sup><a href='#bookmark2'

                        that period, and will not be obliged to calculate its Taxable Income or complete a full Tax
                        Return.</p>
                    <p>This will mean that these eligible Taxable Persons that have elected for the Small Business
                        Relief will benefit from both:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Administrative relief: they will not be required to calculate their Taxable Income and
                                will benefit from simplified tax return filing and record keeping requirements,
                                including the ability to prepare their Financial Statements using the cash basis of

                            <p>Tax relief: they are not required to pay any Corporate Tax on income earned in the Tax
                                Period.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Eligible Taxable Persons can elect for Small Business Relief in their Tax Return. Once the
                        election has been made, they will be able to complete a simplified Tax Return and benefit from
                        the relief.</p>

                    <p>As Table 1 demonstrates, Businesses that elect for Small Business Relief enjoy significant tax
                        and administrative benefits, while remaining subject to a number of compliance requirements.</p>
                    <h4>Revenue threshold</h4>
                    <p>In order to elect for Small Business Relief, an eligible Taxable Person&apos;s Revenue must be
                        below or equal to AED 3,000,000 for the relevant Tax Period and all previous Tax Periods <sup><a
                                href='#bookmark4' id='bookmarkback4'>[4]</a></sup> . Where a Taxable Person&apos;s
                        Revenue exceeds AED 3,000,000 in a Tax Period, the Taxable Person will no longer be able to
                        elect for Small Business Relief, even if its Revenue is equal to or falls below the AED
                        3,000,000 threshold in subsequent Tax Periods. <sup><a href='#bookmark5'
                                id='bookmarkback5'>[5]</a></sup></p>
                    <p>The Revenue for the purpose of this Article shall be determined in accordance with the applicable
                        accounting standards accepted in the UAE. <sup><a href='#bookmark6'
                                id='bookmarkback6'>[6]</a></sup></p>
                    <p>Revenue is defined in the Corporate Tax Law as 'the gross amount of income derived during a Tax
                        Period'. This includes, for example, income from all of the sales a business makes, as well as
                        any other gross income it receives, such as income from the sale of an asset. Revenue is
                        therefore different from profit, which is the difference between a business&apos; Revenue and
                        its costs. The amount of profit a business makes does not have an impact on its eligibility for
                        Small Business Relief. Revenue should be determined based on the arm&apos;s length principle.
                    </p>
                    <p>When determining the Revenue, the income from all Business Activities undertaken by a particular
                        juridical person must be taken into account, and certain defined Business Activities in the case
                        of a natural person.</p>

                            <h3>How does Small Business Relief work?</h3>
                            <p>Small Business Relief allows eligible Resident Persons to elect to be treated as having
                                no Taxable Income in a Tax Period where they have Revenue of less than or equal to</p>
                            <p>AED 3,000,000 in a relevant Tax Period and all previous Tax Periods ending on or before
                                31 December 2026. As a result of this treatment, they will pay no Corporate Tax. The
                                amount of Corporate Tax liability that is not payable based on the relief will depend on
                                the profitability of the Business. This is because Corporate Tax would be paid at the
                                rate of 0% on Taxable Income up to AED 375,000 and 9% on Taxable Income above AED
                                375,000 had the Small Business Relief not been elected for. This means that the amount
                                of Corporate Tax relief enjoyed by Businesses that are able to elect for Small Business
                                Relief is relative to their profitability, as shown in Table 2 below.</p>

                                the Small Business Relief, there would be no possibility to claim this benefit at a

                            <p>As the election must be made in a Tax Return, an eligible Taxable Person seeking to claim
                                Small Business Relief will first need to register with the FTA for Corporate Tax and
                                obtain a TRN in order to be able to make the election. Additionally, they will need to
                                keep information to demonstrate their eligibility for the relief. This includes keeping
                                records of their Revenue. More details on the compliance obligations that apply to

                                    <h3>What does it mean to have no Taxable Income?</h3>
                                    <p>Ordinarily, businesses would calculate their Taxable Income by calculating their
                                        Accounting Income and making adjustments for the Corporate Tax treatment of
                                        certain income and expenditure. This includes excluding Exempt Income, such as
                                        dividends, and adding back non-deductible expenditure, such as fines. Businesses
                                        may also be eligible for other reliefs, such as for transfers within a
                                        Qualifying Group, which would be applied when calculating Taxable Income.
                                        Businesses then have to calculate the amount of Corporate Tax they must pay
                                        based on their Taxable Income.</p>
                                    <p>By contrast, Small Business Relief treats eligible Taxable Persons as having no
                                        Taxable Income for the relevant Tax Period. This means that they will not have
                                        to calculate their Taxable Income, and that they do not need to identify the
                                        relevant expenses that they would otherwise be required to in order to deduct or
                                        apply any other reliefs.</p>
                                    <p>As Corporate Tax is only charged on Taxable Income, Taxable Persons electing for
                                        Small Business Relief for that Tax Period do not need to pay Corporate Tax.</p>
                                    <p>Businesses who elect for Small Business Relief will complete a simplified Tax
                                        Return. Electing for Small Business Relief means that certain other provisions
                                        of the Corporate Tax Law that are relevant to the calculation of Taxable Income
                                        will not apply. Additionally, Businesses that elect for Small Business Relief
                                        will not be required to maintain Transfer Pricing documentation. <sup><a

                            <p>There are specific rules within the Corporate Tax Law for determining whether a Person is
                                a Resident Person, and these differ from many other international residence rules that
                                look to where someone lives or resides. The rules are also different for Natural Persons
                                (i.e. individuals) and Juridical Persons (e.g. companies).</p>

                                    <p>Many businesses will earn income from within and outside of the UAE. Both of
                                        these sources of income must be considered when calculating Revenue. This is
                                        because Revenue is based on gross income and includes all of the income that a
                                        Business earns.</p>
                                    <p>Juridical Persons must include all of their foreign and UAE income when
                                        calculating their Revenue for Small Business Relief purposes. However, Natural
                                        Persons should only take into account foreign income that is related to their
                                        taxable Business or Business Activity in the UAE (in addition to their domestic
                                        income). This is aligned to the rules for Taxable Income.</p>

                                    <p>Accounting standards are sets of rules and principles that are managed by
                                        regulatory bodies, and that govern how businesses report their financial
                                        activities. Some of the rules and principles differ between regulatory bodies
                                        and, as a result, the choice of accounting standard will determine and may
                                        impact the amount of Revenue a business is determined to have earned in a Tax
                                        Period.</p>
                                    <p>Businesses that elect for Small Business Relief will be able to prepare financial
                                        statements based on the cash basis of accounting, if their revenue does not
                                        exceed AED 3,000,000. <sup><a href='#bookmark35'

                                    <p>Revenue is the gross amount of income derived during a Tax Period calculated
                                        according to applicable accounting standards. According to <a

                                            2023</a>, the applicable accounting standard is International Financial

                                                id='bookmarkback37'>[37]</a> </sup>Thus, a business may apply either
                                        IFRS (or IFRS for SME&apos;s), or a Cash Basis of Accounting in order to
                                        calculate their Revenue for the purposes of determining if they are eligible to
                                        elect the Small Business Relief. However, the FTA has the right to challenge
                                        this choice if the outcome is unreasonable.</p>
                                    <p>It is important to note that Revenue is not restricted to the sale of goods or
                                        services by a business. It includes all income earned in the period. For
                                        example, if a business sells an asset like a vehicle, or a part of its business,
                                        the proceeds of these sales must be included in its Revenue calculation.
                                        Non-cash receipts (e.g. goods received in terms of a barter transaction) should
                                        be included in Revenue at the market value.</p>

                                        <p>ABC LLC is a UAE Resident Person. During its most recent Tax Period, ABC LLC
                                            made sales of AED 1,500,000 and received AED 1,000,000 of dividends from UAE
                                            companies. It had operating expenses of AED 2,000,000.</p>
                                        <p>ABC LLC therefore has Revenue of AED 2,500,000, costs of AED 2,000,000 and a
                                            profit of AED 500,000. However, the costs and profit are not relevant for
                                            the purposes of assessing whether ABC LLC is eligible for Small Business

                                    <h3>Implications for Resident Persons that are VAT registered</h3>
                                    <p>Businesses that are registered for VAT are required to charge VAT on certain
                                        products or services that they sell. The VAT charged should not be included in
                                        the calculation of Revenue. This is because the VAT collected must be
                                        transferred to the FTA and does not belong to the Business.</p>
                                    <p>Small Business Relief is a Corporate Tax relief. It does not change the Resident
                                        Person&apos;s compliance requirements for VAT or any other purpose in any way.
                                        This means that while some Taxable Persons can benefit from Small Business
                                        Relief for Corporate Tax purposes and therefore have simplified Corporate Tax
                                        compliance requirements, their VAT compliance requirements will continue as
                                        before.</p>

                                    ending on 31 December 2024, his Revenue was AED 1,850,000 and he elected for Small
                                    Business Relief.</p>
                                <p>During the Tax Period ending 31 December 2025, Mr X agreed to sell his shop to a
                                    friend for AED 1,200,000. Mr X&apos;s Revenue for the Tax Period, including the
                                    proceeds from the sale of the shop, totalled AED 4,150,000.</p>

                                    2,000,000. ABC LLC elected for Small Business Relief for the Tax Period ending 31
                                    December 2024.</p>
                                <p>At the beginning of 2025, one of ABC LLC&apos;s competitors ceased trading suddenly
                                    and ABC LLC experienced a huge increase in sales as a result. ABC LLC now forecasts

                                    than AED 5,000,000.</p>
                                <p>ABC LLC does not need to do anything different immediately. However, if its Revenue
                                    for the 31 December 2025 Tax Period does exceed AED 3,000,000, it will no longer be

                                    on its Taxable Income.</p>
                                <p>In this regard, ABC LLC will need to consider all the relevant provisions of the

                                        <p><strong>Example 11: Tax Losses</strong></p>
                                        <p>ABC LLC is a Resident Person that started trading on 1 January 2025. In the
                                            Tax Period ending 31 December 2025, ABC LLC had Revenue of AED 2,500,000 and
                                            expenses and costs of AED 3,500,000. This resulted in ABC LLC having a
                                            negative Taxable Income (i.e. a Tax Loss) of AED 1,000,000 for the 31
                                            December 2025 Tax Period.</p>
                                        <p>As a Resident Person whose Revenue does not exceed AED 3,000,000, ABC LLC is
                                            eligible to elect for Small Business Relief.</p>
                                        <p>If ABC LLC elects for Small Business Relief, it will be treated as having no
                                            Taxable Income and benefit from simplified compliance requirements. Electing
                                            for Small Business Relief means that the Tax Loss incurred will not be
                                            declared to the FTA and cannot be carried forward to future Tax Periods.</p>
                                        <p>If ABC LLC chooses not to elect for Small Business Relief, it will be able to
                                            declare its Tax Loss to the FTA and the Tax Loss can be carried forward to
                                            be utilised in future Tax Periods. However, in order to do this, ABC LLC
                                            would have to comply with ordinary Corporate Tax compliance requirements,
                                            including calculating Taxable Income and completing a full Tax Return.</p>

                                            other.</p>
                                        <p>In the Tax Period ending 31 December 2026, ABC LLC had Revenue of AED

                                            Period, ABC LLC had carried forward unutilised Tax Losses of AED 700,000.

                                            means that ABC LLC will be unable to transfer any of its unutilised Tax
                                            Losses to DEF LLC.</p>

                                            elect for Small Business Relief. During the same Tax Period, ABC LLC has
                                            excess Interest expenditure of AED 400,000, which is carried forward to be
                                            used in subsequent Tax Periods.</p>

                                            2,000,000. ABC LLC elected for Small Business Relief for that Tax Period. As

                                            income from the dividends are Exempt Income and would not be included when
                                            calculating ABC LLC&apos;s Taxable Income.</p>
                                        <p>As the provisions of the Corporate Tax Law relating to Exempt Income do not
                                            apply when a Business is seeking to benefit from Small Business Relief, the
                                            dividend income should be included in the calculation of ABC LLC&apos;s
                                            Revenue. ABC LLC&apos;s Revenue for the Tax Period is therefore AED

                                            elect for Small Business Relief for the Tax Period ending 31 December 2024.

                                conditions are met, both parties in these types of transactions are able to record the
                                transaction as taking place at net book value. This means that there will be no gain or
                                loss attributed to either party for Corporate Tax purposes.</p>
                            <p>As Business Restructuring Relief and relief for transfers within a Qualifying Group
                                impact both parties in the transaction, businesses will need to consider the impact of
                                their choice on the other party to the transfer or business restructuring transactions
                                they are involved in.</p>

                                        <p>ABC LLC is eligible to elect for Small Business Relief due to having Revenue

                            <p>Companies under common ownership (and meeting other relevant conditions) are able to form
                                a Tax Group. <sup><a href='#bookmark60' id='bookmarkback60'>[60]</a> </sup>This allows
                                these companies to be treated as a single Taxable Person, reducing the compliance burden
                                on individual companies by consolidating accounts and eliminating intra-group
                                transactions, and increasing flexibility in the utilisation of Tax Losses.</p>
                            <p>A Tax Group is able to elect for Small Business Relief if its Revenue is equal to or
                                below AED 3,000,000. As a single Taxable Person, the Revenue threshold for Small
                                Business Relief will apply to the Tax Group as a whole, rather than to each member of
                                the Tax Group. Irrespective of how many companies make up the Tax Group, the Revenue
                                threshold of AED 3,000,000 will apply to the Tax Group as a whole.</p>

                                <p><strong>Example 18: Tax Groups and Small Business Relief</strong></p>
                                <p>ABC LLC is the Parent Company of a Tax Group, which also includes its wholly- owned
                                    subsidiaries XYZ LLC and DEF LLC. During its Tax Period ending 31 July 2024, ABC LLC
                                    itself had Revenue of AED 1,300,000, XYZ LLC had Revenue of AED 900,000 and DEF LLC
                                    had Revenue of AED 1,000,000. None of the Revenues of ABC LLC, XYZ LLC and DEF LLC
                                    are earned from each other.</p>
                                <p>The total consolidated Revenue for the Tax Group (after netting of intra-group
                                    transactions) was therefore AED 3,200,000 (AED 1,300,000 + AED 900,000 + AED
                                    1,000,000).</p>
                                <p>Although each of the companies has Revenue below the threshold for Small Business
                                    Relief, the Tax Group will not be eligible for Small Business Relief. This is
                                    because the Tax Group is treated as a single Taxable Person, and the Tax
                                    Group&apos;s overall consolidated Revenue of AED 3,200,000 is above the Small
                                    Business Relief threshold of AED 3,000,000.</p>

                            <p>An eligible Taxable Person that has elected for Small Business Relief remains a Taxable
                                Person for the purposes of the Corporate Tax Law. This means that it will continue to be
                                required to meet its Corporate Tax compliance obligations in each Tax Period. This
                                includes the obligation to register for Corporate Tax, file a simplified Tax Return and
                                retain all relevant documents and records to support their Corporate Tax filings.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Geographical separation: </strong>This involves artificially separating

                                        Relief threshold. It may also occur where different companies claim to only
                                        operate at certain times, for example, on set days of the week.</p>

                            <h3>Purpose of artificial separation test</h3>
                            <p>There are legitimate circumstances in which a Business may separate its activities or
                                choose to operate through separate entities. For example, someone may wish to operate
                                their Business using more than one limited company in order to limit their legal
                                liability. Therefore, the fact alone that a Business operates through more than one
                                entity is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Business has been artificially
                                separated.</p>
                            <p>In order to determine whether a Business has been artificially separated, the FTA will
                                undertake an artificial separation test. The FTA will review the activity that has been
                                separated to determine:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Whether the separation was undertaken for a valid and genuine commercial purpose;
                                        and</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Whether substantially the same Business or Business Activity is being conducted.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In order for the FTA to conclude that a Business has been artificially separated, both
                                elements must be considered. <sup><a href='#bookmark65'

                            <p>When considering whether a Business has been artificially separated the FTA will consider
                                the individual facts and circumstances of the Business being reviewed, including the
                                financial, economic and organisational links between the separate entities.</p>

                                    <h3>Financial links</h3>
                                    <p>Financial links between entities can be an indicator of artificial separation.
                                        Key questions to consider include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>Does one entity financially support another?</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>Is one entity financially viable without the support of the other?</p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Ordinarily, one Business would not expect to be financially supported by another.
                                        Support in this context can mean one entity lending or giving money to another.
                                        It is important to note that this is distinct from an ordinary commercial
                                        relationship in which an entity charges market interest or a fee to lend money
                                        to another entity.</p>

                                    <h3>Economic links</h3>
                                    <p>Economic links between entities can also indicate that a Business has been
                                        artificially separated. Key questions to consider include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>Do the activities of the entities mutually benefit each other?</p>

                                        <li>
                                            <p>Do the entities have the same group of customers?</p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>If the activities of two or more entities mutually benefit each other this can be
                                        an indicator that they are in Business together. Having the same group of
                                        customers is an additional example of economic links that can indicate
                                        artificial separation.</p>

                                    <p>Organisational and structural links can be important indicators that artificial
                                        separation has taken place. Organisational links show how closely related the
                                        operations of two entities are. Key questions to consider include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>Do the entities conduct Business from the same premises or using the same

                                            <p>Would a customer know that they were dealing with two separate Business
                                                entities?</p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>There are genuine circumstances in which two Businesses operate from the same
                                        premises. In addition, employees are generally free to work for more than one
                                        employer if they wish. Therefore, these questions need to be considered in the
                                        context of the Business being reviewed.</p>

                                <p><strong>Example 20: Functional artificial separation</strong></p>
                                <p>Mr X owns a hotel in Ras Al Khaimah. In the Tax Period ending on 31 December 2024, Mr
                                    X&apos;s Revenue was AED 3,100,000. Mr X was therefore not eligible for Small
                                    Business Relief.</p>
                                <p>On the ground floor of the hotel there is a restaurant where hotel guests can have
                                    breakfast. Breakfast is not included in the price of the hotel room but when guests
                                    check in, they are asked if they would like breakfast and pay for it at the hotel
                                    reception. The restaurant also prepares meals for hotel guests who request room
                                    service. The restaurant is not open to the public.</p>
                                <p>Mr X employs a general manager, Mr Y, who manages both the hotel and the restaurant.
                                    Other employees work in both the hotel and the restaurant.</p>
                                <p>On 1 January 2025, Mr X created a limited company, ABC LLC, to operate the
                                    restaurant. Mr X wholly owns and controls ABC LLC.</p>
                                <p>ABC LLC does not pay rent to Mr X for the use of the ground floor of the hotel.
                                    Guests continue to pay for breakfast at the hotel reception and the restaurant
                                    continues to be closed to the public. Mr Y is still the manager of both the hotel
                                    and the restaurant, and Mr X&apos;s other employees continue to work in both the
                                    hotel and restaurant. ABC LLC has a separate bank account and at the end of each
                                    month Mr X pays ABC LLC the amounts that hotel guests have made for breakfast or
                                    room service in the past month.</p>
                                <p>At the end of the Tax Period ending on 31 December 2025, Mr X&apos;s Revenue was AED
                                    1,850,000 and ABC LLC&apos;s Revenue was AED 1,300,000. Mr X cannot elect for Small
                                    Business Relief as his Revenue previously exceeded AED 3,000,000. ABC LLC elected
                                    for Small Business Relief.</p>
                                <p>This is functional artificial separation, as Mr X and ABC LLC are operating
                                    substantially the same Business. This is on the basis that Mr X and ABC LLC are
                                    closely economically linked. As the restaurant is not open to the public, ABC LLC
                                    has the exact same group of customers as Mr X. The financial links between Mr X and
                                    ABC LLC are also strong. Mr X is ABC LLC&apos;s sole income stream and it is not
                                    clear how ABC LLC could be sustained without receiving hotel guests. Mr X and ABC
                                    LLC are also organisationally close. The hotel and restaurant have shared management
                                    and staff and, given that the restaurant is in the hotel and payment for restaurant
                                    meals is made to the hotel, it is not clear that a hotel guest would understand that
                                    they are dealing with two separate entities.</p>

                                <p><strong>Example 21: Business separated for a valid commercial purpose</strong></p>
                                <p>ABC LLC operates a cafe in Abu Dhabi. On 1 January 2026 DEF LLC entered into a
                                    franchise agreement with ABC LLC. This allowed DEF LLC to open a cafe of the same
                                    name in Dubai.</p>
                                <p>Under the franchise agreement DEF LLC is allowed to use the same branding as ABC LLC.
                                    ABC LLC will carry out all marketing and advertising activity. The agreement
                                    requires DEF LLC to purchase all of its ingredients and packaging from ABC LLC.
                                    Customers would not be aware that the Businesses are separately owned.</p>
                                <p>In this case, it appears that the Businesses have not been artificially separated.
                                    This is an example of a Business being separated for a valid commercial purpose.
                                    Franchise agreements are genuine arrangements which Business owners use to expand
                                    their income without undertaking the additional activity themselves. The requirement
                                    for the franchise owner to carry out all marketing and provide all ingredients are
                                    common clauses in franchise agreements to ensure consistent standards across all
                                    franchisees.</p>

                                    2025. Mr X was the sole employee of ABC LLC and the company&apos;s clients

                                <p>On the same day, 2 March 2025, Mr X incorporated DEF LLC. DEF LLC provided the same
                                    services to the same clients that ABC LLC had, with Mr X as the sole employee of the
                                    company. On 6 September 2025 DEF LLC had made sales of AED 2,750,000. On 6 September
                                    2025 DEF LLC deregistered for Corporate Tax and in its final return declared Revenue
                                    of AED 2,750,000 and elected for Small Business Relief.</p>
                                <p>On the same day, 6 September 2025, Mr X incorporated XYZ LLC. Mr X is XYZ&apos;s sole
                                    employee and XYZ LLC offers the same services to the same clients that DEF LLC and
                                    ABC LLC had previously.</p>
                                <p>This is temporal artificial separation. Mr X is operating substantially the same
                                    Business through different entities by incorporating companies through which he
                                    offers his services, and deregistering them for Corporate Tax when their sales get
                                    close to the Small Business Relief threshold. Each successive entity works with the
                                    same clients and each client appears to understand that they will receive Mr
                                    X&apos;s services. Hence, the structuring of Mr X&apos;s Business was to gain a
                                    Corporate Tax advantage and the artificially separated entities would not be able to
                                    elect for Small Business Relief.</p>

                                <p><strong>Example 23: Geographical artificial separation</strong></p>
                                <p>ABC LLC is a Resident Person that is wholly owned by Mr X. ABC LLC owns and operates
                                    a laundrette in Dubai, which services customers exclusively in the area of Downtown
                                    Dubai. In the Tax Period ending 31 December 2025, ABC LLC had Revenue of AED
                                    2,400,000.</p>
                                <p>Mr X wanted to expand his Business and incorporated two new companies, DEF LLC and
                                    XYZ LLC which services customers exclusively in the area of Business Bay and
                                    Jumeirah, respectively. The laundrettes all traded under separate names but Mr X
                                    controls all of them. Mr X negotiates with suppliers on behalf of ABC LLC, DEF LLC
                                    and XYZ LLC collectively to secure a bulk discount.</p>
                                <p>In the Tax Period ending 31 December 2026, ABC LLC had Revenue of AED 2,500,000, DEF
                                    LLC had Revenue of AED 2,000,000 and XYZ LLC had Revenue of AED 2,100,000. All of
                                    the companies elected for Small Business Relief.</p>
                                <p>This is a geographical artificial separation. Mr X is operating the same Business in
                                    Dubai, albeit with customers in different areas in the same Emirate. Mr X controls
                                    all of the companies and all of the profits are received by him. The companies are
                                    also closely economically linked, by each conducting the same Business they mutually
                                    benefit each other by collectively bargaining with suppliers.</p>
