Examples include interests in certain incorporated partnerships or units issued by an investment fund.</p><section class='level-3'><article id='bookmarkSection5.1.1'><h3>What is an ownership interest?</h3><p>An ownership interest can be understood as any equity or similar interest (for example, a partnership interest) that carries rights to the profits and liquidation proceeds of the Participation.</p><p>A holding can qualify as an ownership interest for the purposes of <a href='/articles/uae-cit-article-23' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>Article 23</a> of the Corporate Tax Law only if it is treated as an equity interest under the Accounting Standards applied by the Taxable Person holding the ownership interest.<sup><a id='bookmarkback32' href='#bookmark32'>[32]</a></sup> This would distinguish between an ownership interest and other rights to the profits and liquidation proceeds of an entity, such as profit-sharing agreements with employees that do not carry any equity rights to the entity or creditors&apos; rights to compel the sale of certain assets to satisfy an obligation of an entity that is in default.</p><p>To the extent that shares or capital held by a Taxable Person grant the same rights to both the profits as well as the liquidation proceeds of the Participation, no consideration needs to be given to the different classes of shares or capital issued. An ownership interest can include, but is not limited to, holdings in any one or a combination of the following instruments:<sup><a href='#bookmark33' id='bookmarkback33'>[33]</a></sup></p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Type of instrument</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Description</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ordinary Shares</p></td><td><p>Category of capital stock or equivalent ownership interest, which gives its owner, on a share-by-share basis, equal entitlement to voting rights, profits, and liquidation proceeds.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Preferred Shares</p></td><td><p>Category of capital stock or equity interest which gives its owner priority entitlement to profits and liquidation proceeds ahead of owners of Ordinary Shares.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Redeemable Shares</p></td><td><p>Category of capital stock or equity interest which the juridical person issuing this instrument has agreed to redeem or buy back from the owner of this instrument at a future date or after a specific event, for a predetermined amount or with reference to a predetermined amount.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Membership and Partner Interests</p></td><td><p>Equity interests owned by a member or a partner in the juridical person, which entitles the member or the partner to a share of the profits, determined with reference to the member&apos;s or the partner&apos;s capital contribution, and which may be transferred to others.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Islamic Financial Instrument or a combination of arrangements that form part of the same Islamic Financial Instrument</p></td><td><p>Islamic Financial Instrument is a financial instrument which is compliant with Sharia principles.</p></td></tr></table><p>The above list of ownership instruments is only illustrative. Other types of participating rights to the profits and liquidation proceeds of the Participation and treated as an equity interest under the applicable Accounting Standards, may also qualify as ownership interests. For example, the definition of Ordinary Shares refers to capital stock which gives its owner equal entitlement to voting rights, profits, and liquidation proceeds. However, shares that do not carry voting rights but have rights to profits and liquidation proceeds can also qualify as an ownership interest.</p><p>Ownership interests may carry rights to profits and liquidation proceeds in different percentages. For example, an ownership interest may carry a right to 20% of the profits of an entity but only 10% of the liquidation proceeds.

Whilst equity gives a residual claim on the assets of the entity, a debt instrument involves an obligation to pay an amount of principal and / or interest usually according to a predefined formula. Typically, the creditor (the lender) is paid in priority to equity holders, having less risk than equity holders, though may not have recourse to the entity&apos;s assets. Hence, ordinarily debt instruments do not qualify as an ownership interest for the purposes of the Participation Exemption.</p><p>However, a debt instrument (including those convertible into equity) is treated as an ownership interest if it is classified as an equity interest under the Accounting Standards applied by the Taxable Person.<sup><a href='#bookmark34' id='bookmarkback34'>[34]</a></sup> Thus, compound financial instruments or hybrid instruments which have features of debt as well as equity may qualify as an ownership interest depending on their accounting classification under the Accounting Standards applied by the Taxable Person.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection5.1.3'><h3>Options</h3><p>An option is a right to buy (call option) or sell (put option) something for a fixed price at a future date. Accordingly, holding an option does not imply that the holder actually or in fact has an ownership interest in an entity. Therefore, the holding of an option would not be considered as holding an ownership interest.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection5.1.4'><h3>Owner of ownership interests</h3><p>The specified income from a Participation is exempt only if it is received by a Taxable Person in their capacity as &quot;owner&quot; of an ownership interest or ownership interests in the Participation.
